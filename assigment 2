Q2)Execute the below code and write your description in txt file
typeof(1)
typeof(1.1)
typeof('1.1')
typeof(true)
typeof(null)
typeof(undefined)
typeof([])
typeof({})
typeof(NaN)



 
typeof(1)-->Number
It is number data type as it is a digit

typeof(1.1)--->Number
It is number data type as it is represenred in decimal number as what ever may be the digits of int float decimal they are always of number type


type('1.1')---->String
It is a string data type if any value represnted in '' or " " its come's under String Data type


typeof(true)--->Boolean
It is a boolean data type as true or false comes under the category of boolen data type


typeof(null)---->object
In JavaScript null is "nothing". ... Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object. 
You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null

typeof(undefined)---->undefined
An undefined value in JavaScript is pretty commonit means a variable name has been reserved, but no value has been assigned to that reference yet. ... The typeof undefined is the string 
"undefined" and undefined is a falsy value that is loosely equal to null but not to other falsy values.
 
typeof([])------>object
In JavaScript, most functions are both callable and instantiable: they have both a [[Call]] and [[Construct]] internal methods. As callable objects, you can use parentheses to call them, optionally passing some arguments. 
 As a result of the call, the function can return a value

typeof({})------>object
In JavaScript, most functions are both callable and instantiable: they have both a [[Call]] and [[Construct]] internal methods. As callable objects, you can use parentheses to call them, optionally passing some arguments. 
 As a result of the call, the function can return a value

typeof(NaN)---->Number
 The type of NaN , which stands for Not a Number is, surprisingly, a number. The reason for this is, in computing, NaN is actually technically a numeric data type. However, 
it is a numeric data type whose value cannot be represented using actual numbers
